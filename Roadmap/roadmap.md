# Machine learning, Sounds cool right? So you want a path to Learn Machine Learning.

### Here's you Complete Roadmap on how you should start your career as a *Machine Learning Engineer* or *Developer*! 👩‍💻👨‍💻


Let's get Started ⬇


## • What is Machine Learning?

### 👉 Before understanding the meaning of machine learning in my own way, let’s see the formal definitions of machine learning.

 
**• Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed.- Stanford**

### Here is my definition of Machine Learning.


**• Machine learning is the ability of the machine to learn on its own with the Help of Algorithms and Data.**

### 👉 Some real Facts, that most people don't know.

• You don't need too much Math to start learning ML.

• You don't need GPU or Special Hardware to start.

• It doesn't matter what's your age.

• You don't need any degree.

• You don't need too much money.

 • Just follow this ⬇

**Everything starts with your School Mathematics.**


**As I said that you don't need to be a Mathematician or get a Master's degree in Maths If, you just start to learn ML. Your school Maths is enough.**

### 👉 I'm pretty much sure that your school teaches you these topics, if yes this should be great for you.

• Linear Algebra

• Probability

• Statistics

• Trignometry

• Arthemitic

**These topics should be enough to start learning ML.**

Now, The Most Important part of your ML journey. Yes, you guess right "Programming".

### 👉 It doesn't matter which programming language you should choose, Pick one of them.

• Python

• Java

• C++

• R

• Javascript

• Julia

### But, my recommendation is **"Python".**


### 👉 So, why Python.

- Less Code.
- Pre-built Libraries.
- Ease to Learn.
- Independent of Platform.
- Wide Community Support.
- More Computing Power.
- Data Generation.
- Better and Faster Algorithm.
- Capital Flow and Investment.

*You need to focus on your Model, not on your Code.*

### 👉 **Congratulations! 🎉 You are somehow ready to learn more about Machine Learning.**

Alright, *We have a handle on Python programming and understand a bit about machine learning*. Beyond Python, there are a number of open-source libraries generally used in practical machine learning.

Now, Start Exploring and Learning about Python Libraries for Machine Learning.

Such as:

• Pandas

• Numpy

• Matplotlib

• Scikit-Learn

### Python Libraries for Machine Learning

👉 **Pandas** - For processing CSV files. Of course, you will need to process some tables, and see statistics, and this is the right tool you want to use.

Here is the best Youtube Playlist to learn Pandas for Machine Learning.

👉 **Numpy** - The famous numerical analysis library. It will help you do many things, from computing the median of the data distribution to processing multidimensional arrays.

Here is the best Youtube Video to learn Numpy for Machine Learning.

👉 **Matplotlib** - After you have the data stored in Pandas data frames, you might need some visualizations to understand more about the data. Images are still better than thousands of words.

Here is the Playlist to learn Matplotlib for Machine Learning.
