# *ML Concepts!*

##### REPO ARCHITECTURE.

The repository was built with a tree-like structure in mind.

It contains folders inside folders.

###### In the supervised learning folder you will find classification and regression folders. Each folder contains a .txt file called "introduction to folder" which talks about the folder and all the stuff contained in that folder.

### CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES

- If you want to create a new folder, please create a  .txt file in the folder you want to create and name it "introduction to folder" and in it write out what the folder will contain; concepts you'll cover, code that will be written, language used, packages to be installed etc. This is done so developers who aren't  familiar with the content in the folder can understand what it's about.

- All code contributions should have explanations.

- Code can be contributed using jupyter notebooks and .py, .r or .jl files. But jupyter notebooks will be much appreciated because they support clear explanation of code.

- All code contributed should concern Machine Learning in one way or another.

#### *WHAT CAN YOU CONTRIBUTE !*

Anything can be contributed as long as it concerns Machine Learning.

If you can't contribute code them you can help fix a typo just make sure you contribute where it's needed.

It's our responsibility as a community to help each other. 
Knock yourself out.
