# Machine Learning for Beginners

 🌍 "Machines are able to see, hear and learn. Welcome to the future". 🌍

The repository was built with a tree-like structure in mind. It contains everything that you need to getting started with Machine Learning.

**It contains folders inside folders.**

> In the supervised learning folder you will find classification and regression folders. Each folder contains a .txt file called "introduction to folder" which talks about the folder and all the stuff contained in that folder.

We feel a lot of the fear people have of Machine learning is due to those unnecessary complex terms.

>It stops people from going into Machine Learning and makes them feel they need to have a degree or something. It's not true, anyone can do ML.

And We plan to make that happen.

**We're working on this open source project, This Repository with coded explanations of Machine Learning concepts like Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and stuff like that.**

## Prerequisites

 - Programming with Python
 - Basics of Data Libraries

**If you are completely new to Machine Learning don't worry we have a Roadmap [Click Here](Roadmap/roadmap.md) on How to getting Started.**

## Run Locally

Currently This Project under developing stage.

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/EdemGold/Nutshell-Machine-Learning.git
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Nutshell-Machine-Learning
```

Switch to pull-request branch

```bash
  git switch pull-request
``` 
 

Travel with us around the world as we apply these classic techniques to data from many areas of the world. Each folder contains a folder. We're going to add quizzes, written instructions to complete the lesson, a solution, an assignment and more.
