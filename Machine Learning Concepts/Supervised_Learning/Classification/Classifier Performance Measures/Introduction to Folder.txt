In this folder we will be talking about the introduction to perfomance measures of a classifier.

After implementing a Machine Learning algorithm,  we need to find out how effective the model is.

The criteria for measuring the effectiveness may be based on the datsets provided and the metric

For evaluating different Algorithms ee can make use of different performance Measures
