# CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES

-  Any contribution is welcomed such as fixing grammatical errors, fixing broken links, adding resources, etc.
- Before contributing, here's our [CODE OF CONDUCT](https://github.com/EdemGold/Nutshell-Machine-Learning/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) which must be adhered to.
- Verify that any resource(s) to be added isn't already present in the repo, as yours may be a duplicate.
- - When making a PR, make the PR to the `sub-main` branch not the `main` branch.
- Use the `[Title Case Name](link)` format
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Pull requests should have a useful title.
- Create a folder to add any Machine Learning concept, make sure the folder contains a detailed explanation of the concept. Also, if there are packages to be installed, create a `.txt` file stating out the packages to be installed and how to install these packages.
- Code can be contributed using jupyter notebooks and `.py`, `.r` or `.jl` files. But jupyter notebooks will be much appreciated because they support a clear explanation of code.
