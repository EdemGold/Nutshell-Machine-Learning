# CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES

We are very excited to have you with us!

## Project Guidelines

- Use the `[Title Case Name](link)` format.
- All Folders and Files should contain `-` inplace of ` ` or `_`.
- Use concise descriptions.
- Pull requests should have a useful title.
- To add any Machine Learning concept, create a folder in the ML Concepts folder with a relevant category.
- Add the concept to be added with detailed explanations.
- if there are packages to be installed, create a `requirements.txt` file stating out the packages to be installed.
- Each folder should contain an `Introduction.md` file.
  - The file should contain a brief introduction to folder.
  - Notebook's Table ( for reference look at this [Introduction.md](./Machine-Learning-Concepts/Introduction.md) )
  - Any other resource or blog you think is appropriate or explains the meaning of your folder.
- Codes can be contributed using jupyter notebooks and `.py`, `.r` or `.jl` files. But jupyter notebooks will be much appreciated because they support a clear explanation of code.

## Follow these instructions for contributions.

- Open your terminal and clone it on your machine:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/EdemGold/Nutshell-Machine-Learning.git
  ```

- Create a new branch with this convention `broadtopic/notebooktopic`

  ```bash
  git checkout -b broadtopic/notebooktopic
  ```

- Commit all the changes (use descriptive commit messages)

  ```bash
  git commit -m "a descriptive commit message"
  ```

- Make a PR on Github; use a descriptive PR title to specify the change(s) made.

- Complete the changes and when ready push with this command.(for first time contributors only)

  ```bash
  git push -u origin broadtopic/notebooktopic
  ```

- Complete your changes and when ready, you can now just use push.

  ```bash
  git push
  ```

## Other Rules

- Any contribution is welcomed such as fixing grammatical errors, fixing broken links, adding resources, etc.
- Before contributing, here's our [Code of Conduct](./Code-Of-Conduct.md) which must be adhered to.
- Verify that any resource(s) to be added isn't already present in the repo, as yours may be a duplicate.
