# CONTRIBUTION GUIDELINES

- Fork the repo
- Open your terminal and clone it on your machine:  
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/EdemGold/Nutshell-Machine-Learning.git
  ```
- Add an upstream link to the main branch in your cloned repo: 
  ```
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/EdemGold/Nutshell-Machine-Learning.git
  ```
- Keep your cloned repo up to date by pulling from upstream (to avoid any merge conflicts while committing new changes): 
  ```
  git pull upstream main https://github.com/EdemGold/Nutshell-Machine-Learning.git
  ```
- Create your  own branch:  `git checkout -b <branch-name>`
- Commit all the changes (use descriptive commit messages): git commit -m "a descriptive commit message"
- Push your changes:  `git push origin <branch-name>`
- Make a PR on Github; use a descriptive PR title to specify the change(s) made.
- Any contribution is welcomed such as fixing grammatical errors, fixing broken links, adding resources, etc.
- Before contributing, here's our [CODE OF CONDUCT](https://github.com/EdemGold/Nutshell-Machine-Learning/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) which must be adhered to.
- Verify that any resource(s) to be added isn't already present in the repo, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Use the `[Title Case Name](link)` format.
- Use concise descriptions.
- Pull requests should have a useful title.
- To add any Machine Learning concept, create a folder in the ML Concepts folder and add the concept to be added with detailed explanations. Also, if there are packages to be installed, create a `.txt` file stating out the packages to be installed and how to install these packages.
- Codes can be contributed using jupyter notebooks and `.py`, `.r` or `.jl` files. But jupyter notebooks will be much appreciated because they support a clear explanation of code.
